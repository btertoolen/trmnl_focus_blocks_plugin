# Focus blocks plugin for TRMNL
Gives you an indication at what part of the day your schedule allows you to spend working on deep work.
This should give you a clear overview of how much focus time you have for the day, allowing you to get an idea of what you can work on and get done.
The minimum free time between calendar events constitutes a focus block, and how many days to look ahead are configurable through variables (todo: turn this into settings).
